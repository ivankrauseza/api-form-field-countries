# Country selector
Get your country by autocomplete when typing the first characters.  

## How it works
In this case, the user is requested to enter a country name into the form field. To save time the user can simply start to write the name of their country and the jQuery method will 'filter' the results into a shorter dropdown list so the user can choose the country by clicking on the required name in the dropdown list.

## Languages & Libraries used
